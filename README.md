Distrubuted Acyclic Directed Graph Generator for Python

dadggpy (pronounced "dad guppy") is a library for generating component based acyclic directed graphs in a distributed task queue using celery. It is heavily influenced by facebook's popular "react" library, but is generalized for any type of acyclic directed graph, not just html.
